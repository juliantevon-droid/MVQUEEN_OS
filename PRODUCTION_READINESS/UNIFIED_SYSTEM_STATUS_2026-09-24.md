# MVQUEEN_OS Unified Production Status — 2026-09-24

## Canonical system

- **Active Git branch:** `main`
- **GitHub role:** source of truth for code, contracts, tests, theme and automation logic.
- **Shopify role:** source of truth for live commerce state.
- **Google Drive role:** archive, assets, references and backups only.
- **Live Shopify writer:** authenticated React Router application under `app/`.
- **Python role:** deterministic intelligence, dry-run, validation, QA and release artifacts.
- **Sister brand:** Miss.Princess.

## Active main hygiene

- 723 tracked files.
- Approximately 3.33 MB of tracked content.
- `.obsidian/`: not tracked.
- `_BACKUPS/`: not tracked.
- Python cache/bytecode: not tracked.
- Root generated session context: retired.
- Legacy local Drive/Termux bootstrap scripts: retired.
- Standalone Python Shopify REST/GraphQL network clients: retired.
- `15_Scripts_And_Code/` contains only its README/index and the canonical `mvqueen_engine/`.

## Drive

The active `MVQUEEN_OS` Drive root retains its original folder identity for compatibility.

Active root structure:
- 40 folders total, including one dated legacy archive.
- 0 loose root files.
- 0 duplicate folder names.
- older MVQUEEN root mirrors moved into `MVQUEEN_ARCHIVE_2026-09-24`.
- legacy runtime/workspace folders moved into `_ARCHIVE_LEGACY_2026-09-24`.

Drive intake validation is read-only and cannot commit or push to GitHub.

## Branch policy

There are 33 non-main historical branch refs. They are recovery references only and are recorded in:
`PRODUCTION_READINESS/HISTORICAL_BRANCH_ARCHIVE_2026-09-24.md`.

No open pull request is an approved production merge source.

## Production gates

Verified during consolidation:
- MVQUEEN Production Readiness — passing.
- MVQUEEN OS Lint and Index — passing.
- MVQUEEN_OS Overseer — passing.
- MVQUEEN Theme CI/CD — passing after theme config normalization.
- MVQUEEN Shopify App CI — TypeScript typecheck and production build passing.
- Unified-system invariant tests — passing.

## Security

Active `main` contains no default Python Shopify credential transport.

A historical branch/file version previously contained a live-looking Shopify credential. Because the repository is public, that credential must be treated as exposed and rotated/revoked in Shopify even though it is no longer part of the active architecture.

## Write boundary

A live product mutation requires both:

1. `MVQ_WRITE_ENABLED=true`
2. the exact product GID in `MVQ_APPROVED_PRODUCT_GIDS`

Protected handles, SKUs, inventory, variants, pricing and image relationships remain outside editorial automation.

## Status

**Architecture consolidation: COMPLETE.**

Further work should extend this canonical system, not create parallel runtimes, Drive code mirrors, duplicate app folders or new production branches.
